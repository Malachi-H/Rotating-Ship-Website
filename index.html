						Rotary Spacecraft is a model-environment bundle with both an
						external and an internal model to keep the files light and the
						reduce the strain on your computer. It includes full detailing and
						texturing of the spacecraft - both the internal and external models.

							The spacecraft consists of discrete segments that are each able to rotate symmetrically around the y-axis. With a light-themed exterior, the cast shadows are more visible, allowing the contours of the model to be clearly defined. Having a predominantly white spacecraft is also beneficial to enhance the contrast with the back background of space.

							As shown in the wireframe rendering to the left, the exterior model is relatively light. It consists of 300,000 vertices at the displayed level of subdivision, which can be adjusted for each object to suit the required quality. The model has 8 counter rotating sections that are each set up to rotate at varying speeds around the y-axis. Both models are fully textured, with a light-themed exterior and a dark-themed interior.

The interior model is fully textured with a dark-themed colour scheme. All of the texturing for both the interior and exterior models are procedural. As such, details and colour can be changed to fit with your personal requirements.

With the timing controlled by keyframes, bridge extends after the iris door has opened to allow a walkway over the blades of the door. The individual extensions of the bridge segments are controlled an armature, allowing the bridge to be extended and retracted as required.
